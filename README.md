##  About Me  
I am a **Robotics Engineer** specializing in developing and training deep neural networks for path generation and integrating ML policies into robotic systems for **sim-to-real deployment**. My experience spans **robot perception (SLAM, mapping, sensor fusion)**, **control systems**, and **AI/ML-driven robotics**.  

I am passionate about **bridging AI and robotics**, building intelligent agents, and deploying real-world robotic systems that are safe, reliable, and efficient.
